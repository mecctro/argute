whatcha got lingering in svn (or what-have-you)?
just stuff i've been working on and lazy about committing, working on an application that generates markup
like a gui, or converter or something?
we have lots of ads, and specialists use a crufty tool at the moment to generate pages, since the 2017 stuff is coming out this is a good time to work on it
webapp
ah
i have the delivery mechanism working, and a mostly built out wizard for the process, and a new template. there are some changes between the old and the new that weren't addressed until this last week and i've been busy working on other shit
so we're using google tag manager to install this crap onto 3rd party sites taht don't support stuff
so the application emits html upon request via some javascript installed via gtm
got all the auth kinks worked out, don't have to worry about rate limiting or anything, changed the schema all around
no idea what google tags are, never had any work with them.
so the idea is information is collected and then poked into a template and the resulting markup is stuffed into the db so we can serve it up
then if there is a change, we can regenerate all the affected pages without having specialists go into 3rd party site backends and install the pages
that old way results in lots of debt
so, it's like a template pre-cache/gen
yup
got caching working too
sounds nifty
i built the app the traditional way, next time i'm doing errthang via api
it's totally the way to go, fuck
basically rpc?
yup!
yea, then there's your no-key stores, or what-have-you
the stack is getting better, much better
fire... whiskey.... quiet.... Cuz the kids aren't invited
totally, i'm still terrified of clientside apps though
they're neat but shit is changing so fast why invest
probably go vue.js since angular is kinda beastly
I love rdbms, but I'm finding myself use no-key stores more and more for simple projects.
Yea, the speed this shit is moving at is mind-boggling.
better fits for most of our workflows, it's like using photoshop for basic resizing tasks, overkill.
exactly, in go-lang managed buffers are really simple/fast for in-app no-key storage.
golang*
My local walmart often has to do more with golang.
I'm so happy to be moving away from php...
i got a scrapper working with it
how's the version control for libs?
that's one thing that i love about rust bruh
I really didn't want to put the effort into JS for server-side.
fuck no
okie dokie
it just seemed... tacky
well, and unstable...
js is such a mixed bag dude
it's pretty cool, and ugly at the same time
it just depends on what you're doing, like anything else.
I would love to toy with rust
I haven't had time yet, though.
golang is more mature, i'm closely watching it
gotta wrap up these applications first then i'll work on a reimplementaiton
going to be around q1
I watched golang for 3 years before I jumped, rust I'm a little uncertain about yet. elixer is interesting, but I'm not holding my breath.
hack isn't horrible looking / hhvm for jit php
oh crystal-lang.org
i'll be dabbling with php for a long while, ~shrugs~ no reason not to use go or others for shit
I'm not a huge fan of ruby tbh
for production apps i want elixir
just spin up a few vm and link them, gg.
current rank for team SoylentNews is 430
php still has its place for me, in particular I still find it to be a really handy template lang.
yeah
you know what's kinda fun? tcl/tk
or when you're too lazy to handle C variables for some seriously simple CLI stuffs
never heard of tcl/tk
old as shit
pretty cool though for whipping up a gui

let me know how your google tag ad thingamajigger works.
I'll have to bookmark these for later toilings.
oh yes
so google tag manager is pretty slick, in the ad world its king
you had me at alphabet
our business revolves heavily around remarketing and google makes it pretty crazy to integrate with services
wtf is remarketing
you look for shoes
a cookie is placed via google tag manager
I get the jist
then when other ads come up
sorry someone came by
no worries
we change whats displayed based on that
we track conversions out the ass
from phone calls, to dealer sales, to web traffic, mailers etc.
I would imagine it would be paramount in that type of business
the cross referencing is the stupid hard work
yeah, we can distill it down to certain figures, "you spent X to get Y"
for example we doubled this guys calls
and their sales dropped
because they weren't picking up the phone, it would ring through
lol
ciri is a butthole
gotta pick up the phone!
facebook/social media is king right now, cheaper than others, biggest profit area is mail though
yeah, well some of these dealerships are run terribly, there's one we do business with that sells 600 cars a month
not bad
really opened my eyes up, for example, this one in Orange County is getting 350k from the manufacturer to move X units
200 if they do X, 350 if they do all. straight cash
they undercut all the competition by ~ $2400
haha
like 12,000 off msrp
it's ridiculous
sounds it
it's all a shell game with dealerships
Think of it is called "racist" and "antisemitic" though he has direct shell access. In my game, because my count is at 69.
unsurprisingly
asshole to mouth
xD
if you catch my drift.
sometimes, in the heat of the moment...
since we have the skinny on deals, kinda funny when coworkers go buy a car
I bet you guys got "the hook up"
best time is the end of the month

NCommander: an idea... how much would an SDR dongle cost?
was about to throw my vm and ssh privkey onto a usb key so i could monkey with it from any computer that can run virtualbox
Bytram, 20-30 dollars. I have never worked with SDR though
Bytram, for one that can do broadcast, I think they are more expensive, most of the HF ones start at like $200

Curious how many more articles I'm going to write
Then might move onto something much more weirder. OS/2 maybe
OS/2 is weird?
well, I guess now maybe
mecctro, well, OS/2 is basically the operating system that was meant to make the 80286/80386 work at full power, and uses things like hardware task switching
(part of the reason its a nightmare to virtualize. It's the only production OS that I'm aware of that actually uses the Intel ring security features)
There are a lot of issues with attempting to virtualive it, or any of the OS/DIGITS
lol
mecctro, the other idea I had was to dig out classic Mac OS and write some extensions, but that's a little obsecure even for me. I don't even know where I could possibly track down the 68k version of MPW or CodeWarrior
mecctro, anything that does something odd in protected mode like multiple GDT segments, or using LDT tends to break most virtualization stuff. VirtualBox is probably running the pack right now, I've heard OS/2 1.x will actually work since it supported emulated 286 LOADALL
NCommander, could always do something for a VAX
TheMightyBuzzard, hardware quicksort and hardware calculate CRC
God that architecture fucking weird
quite a few people tried to port Linux to it and failed miserably
Doesn't help that GCC's support for VAX at best is 'spotty'
even better, plenty of quirks to lengthen the novel
lol
I had never heard about VAX before coming here, so I have no-idea.
just never run into it "in the wild"
i haven't since my bbs days. almost ended up buying one back around 2k though for kicks.
on the trivia note, openvms is working on an x86 release
well, that would might give me the oomph to fiddle.
maybe*
yup, s'what i was thinking
load up a vm and write a bot that runs from it
I'd be interested to dig-in, having never played with it, but a lil bot port would probably be funny.
so there roadmap is aiming for 2018 for x86
I dunno about the VAX, but DEC's MACRO11 assembler was a joy to behold -- consistent instruction set / operand nomenclature.
their*
the operator, e.g., "ADD" was *always*  "ADD", if the operands referenced different kinds of things, well, the OPERAND's reference clearly pointed out what kind of operand it was.
nice
TheMightyBuzzard, I heard about that. Maybe I should shoot them an resume
Won't mind getting into OS development
let's just say that IBM's 360 principles of operation reference was a *pain* after seeing MACRO-ll
NCommander: I don't see how it could hurt, worst case OpenVMS implodes.

that might be a little less obscure, to be fair lol
I'm pretty sure, that some of the things you do violate the 8th Amendment
mecctro, to put it in context, lisa supports Pascal, Basic, and COBOL as development environments
i think we should go evolutionary for one of the next updates. maybe port everything to fastcgi
you know... the one about cruel and unusual punishments
TheMightyBuzzard, I'd like that. We could get off the Apache upgrade train and go to nginx
make that bitch run on Windows!
cmn32480, probably doable with cygwin ;.;
where there's a will...
TheMightyBuzzard, honestly, I'm wondering how hard it would be to make rehash accept markdown for articles
ya, and really we could make it largely webserver variety independent since a LOT of them run fastcgi
indeed
mecctro - where tehre is a will there is usually a dead guy
TheMightyBuzzard, rehash would suck considerably less for long comments and articles if we had markdown ... and maybe syntax highlighting :)
NCommander, not terribly really but i dislike markdown as a general rule. it screws with stuff i meant to look like i wrote.
TheMightyBuzzard, well add it as a choice
cmd32480: a guy equipped with body armor, dead in a term tomb... 
nod nod, that is highly doable. think there's already a lib for markdown even.
looked into it like a year n change ago but didn't think to make it its own mode.

hey, whatcha think about adding a textbox what lets users store their own custom CSS to be included for them on all SN pages?
custom mini-theming sort of thing
As long as we don't accidently cause a XSS
I replace all the CSS on the site now, so it would help me, but not sure who else would find it useful...
TheMightyBuzzard, ugh, this online hilighter has some issues
yar, it would need to be thoroughly bytram'd
mecctro, could lead to custom css sharing too
though most folks just stick with the red cause they're AC
There's certainly niftyness afoot, but XSS would scare the daylights out of me.
even if it did allow js, i'm coming up blank as to how it could be used against anyone besides yourself unless you socially engineered them to use your malware as their user.css
which you can frankly do now. you just have to get them using greasemonkey or the like as well.
Rehash is putting spashes in shitty places
*spaces
but yeah, it shouldn't allow any scripting in it at all. which it wouldn't come to think of it since we'll be running CSP by then.
TheMightyBuzzard, any idea how to make the editor less stupid w.r.t putting random spaces in (not that <pre> ever worked well)
NCommander, yeurg, that's the js area of evilness. i try to avoid it if at all possible.
but the spaces are prolly added in the perl so it shouldn't be all that difficult. would start tracing it down in admin.pl but it's prolly in.... Environment.pm

tama: No mother should have to <worry> about her sons being killed every time they commit armed robbery.

mecctro, it's generally best to start at the top-level script, find the sub you're wanting to change, and open whatever file it's in for further chasing or editing.

I'll keep it in mind buzz, good luck with the shopping.

Hi guys
hi BadCoderFinger 
Eyo!
Oh, hey juggs, how are you?
not bad thanks - having a lazy weekend mostly
unsurprisingly - looks like I need to recompile ZNC following my upgrade shenanigans
The endless upgrade train, gotta love it.
Not that I'm immune, I did my time with Arch, heh.
Sounds painful. This is very much vanilla debian server so pretty much as straight forward as it comes
Yeah, Debian was always the least amount of headache to upgrade.
aha - more a case of a little patience rather than needing to recompile znc it seems :)
Aw, I'm a coder, I never pass up a chance to recompile!
I will have to anyway as I need to grab a newer version - just wanted to upgrade the OS first
In that case, happy compiling!
If you hit a snag, maybe I can help.
hmmm.... seems znc 1.4 is now in the jessie repos (it was some horrible out of date version in the wheezy repos). /me needs to look at the change logs between 1.4 & current 1.6 versions then decide whether to go with the repo version or not
Two minor versions could mean a lot of reading...
indeed. I know there's been a lot of functionality changes - but last I read nothing additional I would actually use! More concerned if there are any security patches
btrfs snapshot?
vps snapshot
Ah, cool.
my connection at home is too damn flaky to run anything that needs any kind of connectivity reliability
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I'm rather unwilling to give comcast any money, so it's CenturyLink, which is almost as bad. Much like presidents, ISPs are always a choice of lesser evils.
And thar it goes
Heh!
Internet ghosts... Isn't there a good movie about those? With a crappy remake on the way?
Ghost In The Machine or some such?
Yeah, that was the joke.
Not an exact fit, though, so maybe not as funny as it was in my head.
It's ok, I'm an odd one, my humour isn't always on the right wavelength.
right wavelength for you - you gives a damn if others get it or not :D
who*
[SoylentNews] - Puzzling X-Ray Emissions From Pluto - http://sylnt.us/1ae - now-one-from-the-other-side
Yeah, well, respect is the true currency of an engineer.
So sometimes it's nice when someone else is on the same wavelength. Of course, when I watch american tv, I'm rather happy that I don't relate.
snapshot complete... powering up for final sanity checks... very smooth other than a couple of GPG keys and apt having a little brainfart and needing it's bottom cleaned
Heh, nice!
Oh - and remembering to change the choice of kernel via the vps provider GUI.... still not sure I understand the need for that....  you do a dist-upgrade in the vm which pulls in a new vmlinuz kernel, but then it actually boots up with something else defined in the hypervisor I guess ~shrug~
right oh... time to check this shizzle out
That's... odd. You'd think there would be one and only one way to select the kernel.
The hypervisor seems to just inject the kernel at boot time - think it's a KVM thing. ~shrug~ I'm no expert on that
Yeah, that's a QEMU thing, inherited by KVM.
They should replace the internal method with a warning, though. "You should really change your kernel via the admin interface, this won't work."
Definitely!
My work box (Xubuntu, sigh) has a lot of RAM chewed up.
My OpenBSD craptop is 144 MB.
I'm not sure how they could insert that warning though without getting all intrusive on what people are doing within their VMs. In the provider GUI this vps still shows as debian 6 but actually it's been upgraded to 7 and now 8. These cloudy vps providers really have nailed the whole orchestration stuff, it's so damn slick being able to spin instances up and down willy nilly in less than a minute.
Yeah, that's true. It would seem like crossing the line.
My minty craptop is currently eating 1.5GB - but meh, headless servers and desktop UI installs are very different beasts
It's not like RAM is the ridiculously expensive proposition it was many years ago
That's true, I prefer mine to be ZFS cache, heh.
Which OpenBSD does not have. That's the reason I still have a FreeBSD box.
OK - nginx has shat its ssl config for some reason during the upgrade
Natch!
Andd... back
Hey, mostly there, can't complain about that.
newp - easy fix I'm sure. 
it happens
there's nothing of note being served - just some MUD maps I did way back when SN had a MUD server running
not going to bother
probably not even worth it.
caddy has tls enabled by default
also pretty light, not sure what all you're doing... but if it's that simple, meh.
newp not worth it. This is just my irc bouncer box, just stuffed nginx on there as it was convenient at the time as somewhere to put these maps. They're just tiddly ascii files. CBA with the cert maintenance crud to put them behind ssl/tls for no benefit to anyone.
caddy sets up tls on it's own, I only mentioned it in-case it comes up again. I wouldn't want to do the https cert shuffle for something tiny / unprivate either.
Someone might hack them. Better list the SHA hash of the files to be sure. ;)
mim-zy
can you imagine the effort, just to change some text
I could go the letsencrypt route, but I CBA even with that honestly. Oh no... someone might snoop on some ascii mud maps
snoopes gonna snoop
I am happy for them to snoop on my carefully crafted maps... means one less thing they can snoop on elsewhere given finite resources xD
"snoop me please sir"
they probably knew you had ascii maps before you even thought you would have them.
I have no idea why, but chortle sounds like something that should be in a Boston accent.
choytul
"I choose you Chortle!"
something like that
It's a Vega Strike reference and relates to my current choice of nick... surprised he remembers it 
what was juggs a reference to?

man, open source textbooks are GREAT
I paid only $13 for my math book

Hi
hello
how're things?
how is your day?
pretty good, first day of school
what's your major?
right now, I'm getting a transfer degree
then I'll go to University of Washington and go for EE
that's the current plan
good for you
I'm very pleased that we use open source textbooks
I'd like to go back for my Physics PhD
my math book only cost $13
wow
my friend paid $350 for his physics textbooks
I got hassled by a security guard for singing on the street.
But I stood my ground - I had the right to sing there.
He stood there and glared at me through my entire set
lol
I'm going to go back tomorrow
I don't care if no one tips me it's fun to hassle the guards
I think security guards get a superiority complex
I figured that if he was in the right, he would call the police.
what were you singing?
I was there about a half an hour, but no cops
yeah, it's mostly threats from those types
The Star Spangled Banner, America the Beautiful, My Country 'Tis of Thee, Battle Hymn of the Republic, O Clementine
ahh
I've heard The Star Spangled Banner is extremely difficult to sing
It is
I don't really have the range for it yet
There are really four verses, but only the first gets sung
yeah
I think it's in a weird timing or something too
yes
I got up at six this morning after only four hours sleep.  That's unlike me.
I think it's the new happy pills
pretty much the same for me, except without the pills
I need to get back to sleeping normally
do you feel sleepy?  I don't.  It's a very odd experience.
yeah, pretty tired, gonna tough it out though
with caffeine

I used to be a morning person, but working on this site 'til near midnight many a night has kindof put an end to that
of course, I wsa up at 0500 today, so things change, yanno?
yea
it's nice seeing you back here... how long has it been?
I've been on SN for about two years I think
finally decided to see if I could contribute to development.
but it's going to have to wait till I can see daylight again
yeah, I hear ya on that one!
I've poked at a few thins on the site, but feel like I really need to make some time to *really* dive in

i started earlier, but much the same here.
unfortunately, looks like I'll have night work again this winter

btw, I really enjoyed your journal article about yellowstone!
thanks
had a great balance of suspense and anticipation
wish I had more to write about, but I just feel like a slouch all day
maybe my downtime before December will recharge my batteries.
I understand... some days the 'muse' is with me, and on others... not so much
that's one of the reasons I'm thinking of moving to days
at least I'll have more energy for doing stuff at Yellowstone
getting some sunlight sure helps with my attitude on life
yannno... have you ever given any thought to being an editor on the site?  You certainly seem to have the writing chops based on that story and other things I've seen from you.

The problem Bytram is that I have rather opinionated views and maybe a really loud mouth
[SoylentNews] - High School Slacker Hacker Gets LTE for Free, T-Mobile Customers Confused - http://sylnt.us/1ax - formerly-freebie
I'd rather be arguing over other things than whether my views are influencing my editing decisions
but yes, I have thought about it
that's honest -- I respect anyone who recognizes their shortcomings/weaknesses and is willing to own them.
well, i suppose if one really wanted to, there's a way to impose views on things... 
I think a lot of people really want to, it's kind of a traditional human thing
but in most cases, there's the knowledge of community 'feedback' -- that helps keep me in check
true, this is not an echo chamber
takes a bit of a tough skin, too,.
I agree with that. That's moderately what happened to me with my current job
Although I was able to make some lemonade out of those lemons
good!
not the needing tough skin part, the making lemonade part!!
I remember they initially offered the same pay as my old day job
yea
but the job was open in the first place because nobody else wanted it
it had more responsibility
ooops.
and night work of course
did it havfe more authority?
A little
responsibility w/o authority 8stinks*
I currently supervise a team of nine other people
that's quite a few
and I get a huge amount of cooperation from everyone else in the department
NICE!
teamwork++
karma - teamwork: 28
It's exhausting because the work is seasonal, the turnover rather high, and the training rather onerous for a seasonal job
It takes about a month for someone good at the work to get up to speed
ugh.
it can take more than the entire season for someone who isn't so capable
And then I lose about two thirds of the staff between summer seasons
so, just when they become truly useful, they're gone. :(
you got it
If Yellowstone were further south, we probably would have a bunch of full time people and it wouldn't be quite as big a problem
is there some way to partition things so the 'seasoned' folk can deal with the 'hard' stuff, and leave more of the 'simple' stuff for the new hires?
not really unfortunately
bummer!!
everyone tends to work at a location by themselves
oooooh.
there's some stuff that they can do, like call others and ask questions
yea, BTW this is night auditing
making sure it stays dark at night?
it's pure entering in sales data, checking for mistakes
;)
no kidding
and fixing problems before guests wake and wonder why this is on their bill
aha.
checking laundry brb
so we're talking about much more than just random concession stands
k
time for dishes... biab, too.
yea Bytram, I work for a concessionaire that manages all the hotels, lodges, and cabins, most of the restaurants, and all of the big campgrounds in the park
that's quite an operation!
is it all done on paper or do they have some automation / databases / etc.
there is some automation though there's plenty of room for improvement
I could kinda tell. =)
we stick all of the data onto a common spreadsheet and then it automatically distributes to who needs it
a lot of the auditor work could be automated
but that would require paying someone
just having a filter to pull out the common errors and automagically attend to those should help.
heh.
But we also go through signed receipts and other paperwork
ahhh.
so that would hard to automate
scanner
OCR
yea
but I hear ya.
or a fancier point of sale system
if the signatures are electronic, then that's a huge part of the overall workload
ooooh, so the auditors have to be at the physical location to deal with the paper-trail
indeed
and I often end up traveling a fair bit over the night
so, the auditors have to go to the data, instead of bringing all the data to one place.
basically each auditor stays at the location
with a few travelers who move between a pair of locations
do you have internet to each location?
nod nod
yes, except for one particularly isolated location which doesn't have an auditor
remind me not to stay *there*
In addition, there is an even larger day staff at each location
makes sense
that's when there are more people around
people don't go to Yellowstone for the internet :)
they handle a lot of other stuff too
but some people who do go there wonder why they can't get online, too, I bet.
you bet
especially kids
LOL
they keep complaining that their brain parasite isn't working right :)
ROFL!
but I need to update my fartbook!
civ 5 over here.
now wait a minute... that might actually be something important!   <tongue location="cheek">
currently I'm just making sure my workers are working
not very difficult
that's a very good place to start.
there isn't even another player within half a world of me
reason I asked about internet... maybe you could, effectively, 'skype' all the auditors together?
I'm not even seeing barbs until now and they're on very rabid
meh, sort of
as long as we don't have to connect via a node outside of the park
the exit is pretty messed up
yeah, INTRAnet
then sure, we could do that
we keep connected by phone right now
idea being you could hold up a receipt, for example, and others could *see* what you were talking about.
I'm currently playing on some huge Earth map with three computer players
would cut down on the amount of talk needed to describe a problem.
yea.
currently, we can't scan that stuff
a skype-like interface might not have the resolution
why not?
sorry, my msg crossed with yours.
no scanners :)
as to the resolution
sometimes it's stuff like trying to make out a signature
which kind of looks like another signature with a guest attached
a cheap camera phone would prolly be good enough... upload, send.
yea
unfortunately, it's a tenuous justification at present
usually, anything that they have problems with can be resolved by calling me
and verbally describing the situation
hmmm
and when it can't there's always the day staff to make it better ;-)
we can't afford to spend a lot of time on a single problem
if it can't be resolved quickly then we often just move on
unless we're in late season like now and are bored
pick the location where it would provide the best benefit, and do a rollout of skype/scanner/whatever THERE.
nod nod
phone call... biab
laundry coming up
yeah, gtg.  been great chatting with ya!
hope you have a great night!!

hi khallow
hi
I think my article broke the community
Hmm, I didn't realise those sorts of articles were welcome.
I've a bunch of articles I wrote for newsgroups a while ago, and I was looking for a new home for them.
Technical articles, that is.
I didn't realise you were doing a series.
You could submit them if you wanted; or you could just post them as journal entries.
I don't remember if SN has the "submit journal to editors for potential inclusion on the front page" that /. does
It'd spare me the pain of finishing my new website, at least...
you should go back to working on getting Pale Moon working on BSD.  :)
A lot of it is deeply-embedded related, exploiting such systems, inventing new and exiciting Forth implementations and a sprinkling of scientific data acquisition and processing.
Pft!
I did sit down and digest some of that other fella's patches, but they're a bit crap. I might as well work off Tycho, I reckon.
First problem I've encountered is the segfault in libxul when trying to parse an XPI.
that's probably the place to start - especially if you figure on it taking you a while.
That'll fix installing extensions, at least.
Aye, it's a matter of having spare cycles, but I'm sufficiently displeased with FF to do so.
Even if it costs me my sanity having to deal with autohell.
boru, you're trying to get Mozilla working on BSD? Brave man
boru, I tried to port Firefox 10 to IRIX. I got as far as getting Spidermonkey to pass it's self-test and XPI to initialize but I couldn't get the entire thing to link; not enough address space (stupid thing is too fat)
This is PM, as opposed to FF; It links and runs with some judicious autoconf flaggy bits just fine, so far.
i.e. turning off the Linux bits.
So far, so good, but it's not near ready for prime time just yet.
boru, well, PM is still based on the common Mozilla code. XPI is absolute pain since its poorly documented, and you have to know both your hardware architecture and calling conventions to make it go
FreeBSD's userland allocated storage implementation is jemalloc, so it's 5x5 turning that stuff in PM.
NCommander: "based on" yes, but has diverged considerably.
AndyTheAbsurd, my understanding is it was still based on the core frameworks. XPI, NSS, and NSPR + Gecko
Yeah, some of the devs have told me about the fun inner workings.
[SoylentNews] - Three Percent own Half of America‚Äôs Guns - http://sylnt.us/1b5 - taking-aim-at-statistics
I've been tempted to write patches for Pale Moon to add DANE support but I dunno if they'd be accepted
they've forked Gecko as well - their version is called Goanna
Missed that bit
Doesn't surprise me. Gecko really has gotten fudgly since Mozilla basically "just don't care" on a lot of it as far as I can tell. the WebGL stuff is beyond horrid
Caused the devs a bunch of trouble because there's a user-agent detection library that just searches for "Goa" to detect the mobile device Wiko Goa.
I'd maintain the FreeBSD port, but I'd like to trick^Wtalk someone into helping with bug finding and patches.
And both Moonchild and Matt A. Tobin have repeatedly stated that patches are welcome, so make them prove it. :)
Since I don't have the cycles to be very active at the moment.
boru, FreeBSD ports team would probably help a lot
You miscontrue, that part is easy. I've been a port maintainer for a while.
I mean the actual modifications to the PM codebase.
boru, you need commit access ;)
they're both pretty active in #palemoon over on Freenode
That's not a problem.
boru, what sort of articles would you like to run?
boru, I'm glad to have other people run original content for SN
More or less what I alluded to above. Nothing to get the site into trouble, though.
Though, arguably, those are the interesting parts.
boru, feel to write it up, and we can post and edit it. I can give you an editor's account on dev to let you draft it sanely, and then copy it over when its done
Aye, I might take you up on that if/when I get around to it. It's all plain text, so it'll probably need a bit of dressing up for the site.
Shame we can't submit via NNTP!
boru, I actually did some work on tying SN to NNTP awhile ago. Got semi-bidirectionaity working but INN is kinda crap for this sort of thing
Indeed. The web is broken.
boru, https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=14/07/21/1627239
^ 03SN article:  Request For Comments: SoylentNews->Netnews (NNTP) Gateway 04(39 comments)
I'll grok that in a bit.
boru, the largest problem is basically INN sucks hardcore for getting data out and moderated groups. You have to have a DIY filter to handle Approved, and then kick it backwards into an outbound UUCP spool where perl could grok it into posts. To ties into username authetication gets into very very ugly territory
Well, you can use any external auth mechanism you want.
(With INN that is)
I think the solution is to do away with the website altogether and just host an NNTP server.
SNR would soar!
I can imagine tying the commenting together is a bit of a pain in the arse, though.
boru, right, but I can't embed that information into headers easily. i.e., user X sent post X without patching INN
boru, furthermore, for things like moderation, I'd have to tie in the ability to cancel and repost for score changes which would change the sequence ID in NNTP causing a message to show as NEW
Ah, I see where you're going, I  think.
Yeah.
So I'm reading through Ncommander's TSR article and I thought, if we want to persue ho-to's and other user submitted tech articles, how do we find them easily in the future for reference without resorting to bookmarks?
How about a new category with a quick link for the how-to's and technical stuff?
LoRdTAW, We're adding a new Nexus in the future for original content. Right now, I've just dumped them into /meta since that's where all "original" content (mostly site stuff) goes
Ah, excellent. I look forward to it.
Tags and filters would be useful for that, also, as well as my own personal grumpiness; I really wish I could filter out politically-slanted articles...
LoRdTAW, we have a site update brewing, but it got sidetracked by TheMightyBuzzard
boru, you can filter by author and by topic
Sure, but a blacklist would be nice e.g. everything-except-politics
... you used to be able to filter by topic
That appears to have broken
boru, we might move politic stories to their own nexus, which can be then filtered out or displayed "minimized"
Define 'nexus'.
boru, a special top level category for stories. They get a special banner on the top
I hope you don't mean something like `subject.sn.org` -- it'd be a pain in the hoop  having to switch domain to read multiple categories I'd be interested in. Say, technology and science, for example.
Hmm.
boru, its actually the same feature, but we rewrote it to use soylentnews.org/nexus_name
(we can attach a seperate subdomain if we want. I.e., if we ever do soylentnews.jp, we can host it on one copy of the site, and then just have content loaded automatically)
I still kind of like my filtering idea. 'Filter' being the keyword; I want to read anything which might be interesting, but not topic X.
Fair enough if that's unrealistic. Just thinking aloud.
boru, still tricky to implement though TBH. I'll accept patches for it if you want to implement it.
Noted. I'll have to patch life, first.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/boru/responsibilities bs=1M skip=1 # first MB has things like eating and breathing
