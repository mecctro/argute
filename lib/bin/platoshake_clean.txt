INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS. The Republic of Plato is the longest his works with exception Laws, and certainly greatest them. There are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in Philebus Sophist; Politicus or Statesman more ideal; form institutions State clearly drawn out Laws; as art, Symposium Protagoras higher excellence. But no other Dialogue has same largeness view perfection style; shows an equal knowledge world, contains those thoughts which new well old, not one age only but all. Nowhere there a deeper irony greater wealth humour imagery, dramatic power. Nor any writings attempt made interweave life speculation, connect politics philosophy. centre around Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches highest point (cp, especially Books V, VI, VII) ancient thinkers ever attained. among Greeks, like Bacon moderns, was first who conceived method knowledge, although neither them always distinguished bare outline from substance truth; both had content abstraction science yet realized. He metaphysical genius whom world seen; him, than thinker, germs future contained. sciences logic psychology, have supplied so many instruments thought after-ages, based upon analyses Socrates Plato. principles definition, law contradiction, fallacy arguing circle, distinction between essence accidents thing notion, means ends, causes conditions; also division mind into rational, concupiscent, irascible elements, pleasures desires necessary unnecessary--these great forms all found Republic, were probably invented by logical truths, writers on most apt lose sight, difference words things, been strenuously insisted him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff), he avoided confusion own (e.g. Rep.). does bind up truth formulae,--logic still veiled metaphysics; imagines 'contemplate existence' very unlike doctrine syllogism Aristotle claims discovered (Soph. Elenchi, 33. 18). Neither must we forget that third part larger design included ideal history Athens, political physical fragment Critias given birth world-famous fiction, second importance tale Troy legend Arthur; said fact inspired some early navigators sixteenth century. This mythical tale, subject wars Athenians against Island Atlantis, supposed founded unfinished poem Solon, it would stood relation logographers poems Homer. It told struggle for Liberty Tim. 25 C), intended represent conflict Persia Hellas.

Again, regarded 'captain' ('arhchegoz') leader goodly band followers; original Cicero's De Republica, St. Augustine's City God, Utopia Sir Thomas More, numerous States framed model. extent Aristotelian school indebted Politics little recognised, recognition himself. two philosophers common they conscious of; elements remain undetected Aristotle. In English too, affinities traced, Cambridge Platonists, Berkeley Coleridge, ideas. That experience, bears witness herself, conviction our generation enthusiastically asserted, gaining ground. Of Greek authors at Renaissance brought influence. treatise education, Milton Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, Goethe legitimate descendants. Like Dante Bunyan, revelation another life; Bacon, profoundly impressed unity knowledge; Church exercised real influence theology, Revival Literature politics. Even fragments when 'repeated second-hand' (Symp. 215 D) ages ravished hearts men, seen reflected their nature. father idealism philosophy, politics, literature. And latest conceptions statesmen, such reign law, equality sexes, anticipated dream him. argument search after Justice, nature hinted Cephalus, just blameless old man--then discussed basis proverbial morality Polemarchus--then caricatured Thrasymachus partially explained Socrates--reduced Glaucon Adeimantus, having become invisible individual reappears length constructed Socrates. care rulers model, providing improved religion morality, simplicity music gymnastic, manlier strain poetry, harmony State. thus led conception State, 'no man calls anything own,' 'marrying nor giving marriage,' 'kings philosophers' 'philosophers kings;' intellectual moral religious, youth whole life.
